### Functions

#### `deposit()`
Prompts the user to enter a deposit amount and validates the input. It keeps asking until a valid positive number is entered.

#### `getNumberOfLines()`
Prompts the user to enter the number of lines to bet on (up to 4). It keeps asking until a valid number is entered.

#### `getBet(balance, lines)`
Prompts the user to enter the bet amount per line. It validates the input to ensure it is a positive number and does not exceed the available balance divided by the number of lines.

#### `spin()`
Generates the slot machine's reel symbols by randomly selecting symbols based on their defined counts. It returns a 2D array representing the reels.

#### `transpose(reels)`
Transposes the reels array to get a row-wise representation of the slot machine grid.

#### `printRows(rows)`
Prints the rows of the slot machine grid.

#### `getWinnings(rows, bet, lines)`
Calculates the total winnings based on the bet amount, number of lines, and the symbols in each row. It returns the total winnings and the winning lines.

#### `game()`
Main game loop that handles the user deposit, betting, spinning the reels, calculating winnings, and updating the balance. The game continues as long as the user has a positive balance.
